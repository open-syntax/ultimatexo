## Making Scripts Executable

After cloning the repository, make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These scripts are used by GitHub Actions workflows:

- **deploy.sh** is called by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **health-check.sh** is used for smoke tests after deployment

## Local Development

For local development, you can use these scripts to:

1. Test deployment locally before pushing
2. Verify health of local Docker setup
3. Practice rollback procedures

## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts:

1. Follow the existing naming convention (kebab-case)
2. Include shebang line: `#!/bin/bash`
3. Add help text with `-h` or `--help` flag
4. Use exit codes appropriately
5. Include colored output for better UX
6. Document the script in this README

## Security Notes

- Scripts should never contain hardcoded secrets
- All sensitive data should come from environment variables
- SSH keys and tokens should be passed securely
- Always validate input parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

```bash
chmod +x scripts/script-name.sh
```

### Script Not Found

Make sure you're running from the project root:
```bash
cd /path/to/ultimatexo
./scripts/script-name.sh
```

### Environment Variables Not Set

Check your `.env` file or export variables:
```bash
export RELEASE_VERSION=v1.0.0
export IMAGE_BASE=ghcr.io/open-syntax/ultimatexo
```

## Contributing

When contributing scripts:

1. Test thoroughly in multiple environments
2. Handle errors gracefully
3. Provide clear output messages
4. Update this README with documentation
5. Add examples of usage
